# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Phase 6 — Frontend Implementation

The frontend implementation follows the architecture defined in Phase 4 and does not introduce additional structural changes.
## Phase 3 — API & Access Pattern Design

API contracts and access patterns are defined in GEMINI.md and were validated against the existing Supabase schema and RLS policies.
# Phase 7 — Permission & Integration Testing

This phase defines role-based test scenarios, negative access cases, and storage access validation focused on Supabase RLS enforcement.
# Phase 8 — Performance, Security & DX Hardening

This phase documents performance considerations, RLS optimization notes, security hardening, and developer experience improvements.
## Phase 9 — Production Readiness & Future Evolution

This phase covers environment separation, migration and rollback strategy, backups, monitoring, and rules for safe long-term schema evolution.
